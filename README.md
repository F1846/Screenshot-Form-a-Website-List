This script takes screenshots of a list of websites and stores them in an output folder.

You can customize the script to make it faster and more efficient.

It includes a user interface (UI) where you can either manually input URLs or upload a CSV file containing the URLs.

You can also choose the output format for the report: CSV, Excel, or no report at all.

The report lists which screenshots were successful and which failed, due to site verification requests or website unavailability.
